    "Besides determining subcontractor productivity, it is essential to consider location-based productivity as well. This is because certain locations may have inefficient logistics and working plans, which can contribute to lower overall productivity. Assessing location-based productivity provides valuable insights that cannot be solely obtained from subcontractor productivity analysis. The query algorithm begins by examining all activities conducted within the past six weeks. It then evaluates the specific spaces in which these activities took place. Finally, it checks the completion status of each activity to calculate the completion rate. By analysing this information, areas or floors with lower productivity can be pinpointed and assessed for potential issues in logistics or working plans. This enables stakeholders to address these concerns and take appropriate measures to improve overall productivity in those specific locations."

    "\n",
    "1. **Identifying Relevant Activities:**\n",

    "2. **Time and Completion Status:**\n",

    "   - Groups the results by organization (`GROUP BY ?org`).\n",

    "   - Limits the results to the top 10 organizations with the most incomplete activities (`LIMIT 10`).\n",

    "1. **Selecting Organizations and Reasons:**\n",
    "   - For each activity (`?activity`), it identifies the associated organization (`?org`) and the reason for delay (`?reason`).\n",
    "   - It ensures the activity is part of the same top 10 organizations identified in the inner subquery.\n",

    "2. **Counting Reasons:**\n",

    "3. **Grouping and Sorting:**\n",

    "In summary, this SPARQL query identifies the top 10 organizations with the most activities not completed in the last six weeks (up to April 1, 2022) and then finds the most common reasons for delays in these activities.

Understanding the reasons behind these replans, as well as identifying the organizations involved and affected, is crucial.
