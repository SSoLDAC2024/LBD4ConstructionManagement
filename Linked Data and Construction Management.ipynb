    "Besides determining subcontractor productivity, it is essential to consider location-based productivity as well. This is because certain locations may have inefficient logistics and working plans, which can contribute to lower overall productivity. Assessing location-based productivity provides valuable insights that cannot be solely obtained from subcontractor productivity analysis. The query algorithm begins by examining all activities conducted within the past six weeks. It then evaluates the specific spaces in which these activities took place. Finally, it checks the completion status of each activity to calculate the completion rate. By analysing this information, areas or floors with lower productivity can be pinpointed and assessed for potential issues in logistics or working plans. This enables stakeholders to address these concerns and take appropriate measures to improve overall productivity in those specific locations."

    "In addition to obtaining subcontractor productivities per floor, it is equally crucial to determine the overall completion rate of subcontractors. This information plays a vital role in identifying underperforming subcontractors and taking necessary corrective actions. Listing 5 presents a query specifically designed to calculate the completion rate of various subcontractors on a weekly basis. The query algorithm retrieves all activities performed within the last six weeks and identifies the responsible subcontractor for each activity. Subsequently, it checks whether each activity has been completed and aggregates the data on a weekly basis for each subcontractor. TThis data aids in the identification of subcontractors with lower performance and assists in implementing appropriate measures to rectify any issues."
