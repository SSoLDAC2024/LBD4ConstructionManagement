# LBD4ConstructionManagement
Supports Linked Data and Construction Management Lecture 
## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook, titled "LBD4ConstructionManagement" has been prepared for a summer school lecture on the importance and application of linked building data in construction management. The notebook is designed to provide an in-depth exploration of how linked data can be utilized to enhance communication, integration, and management within the construction project.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lecture, participants should be able to:

* Recognize the benefits of using linked building data in construction management.
* Basic understanding of the [cSite ontology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580523004843#bi0005)
* Identify the challenges and solutions associated with implementing linked data in construction projects.

## Prerequsites
Participants are expected to have:

* A basic understanding of data management concepts.
* Some familiarity with Python programming.

## Software Requirements
* Python 3.8 or higher
* Libraries: rdflib, pandas, matplotlib (installation instructions are provided within the notebook)

## Usage

1. Clone this repo or download "Linked Data and Construction management.ipynb" and "ProjectGraph.ttl" to your computer.
2. Open Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded notebook.
4. Open the notebook file "Linked Data and Construction management.ipynb".
